This project is an application written in Vue.js where most of the styling was done with it's vuetify library. It represents an online burger shop where you can order your favorite burger and it also has an admin panel where you can edit data. User data is placed at store so you can login with those credentials or you can register your account, but it only lasts one session. For burger data I have used a public API found on rapidapi.com, so note that ussage of it is limited to 10 calls per day.
Live version is available at:
